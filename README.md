# Early-Disease-Predictor-Web-App
**Machine Learning model to predict chances on various diseases deployed on streamlit**

## About the Project
The project is based on data analysis model developed to predict DIABETES, HYPERTENSION and DEPRESSION 

For the data analysis, [Click here](https://github.com/imakshit/Early-Disease-Predicor-Based-on-ML/tree/master/Diabetes_hypertension_depression_prediction_analysis)

## From analysis to web app
Converting any Machine Learning to web app, you can use *STREAMLIT*

Streamlitâ€™s open-source app framework is the easiest way for data scientists and machine learning engineers to create beautiful, performant apps in only a few hours!  All in pure Python. All for free.

You can visit the [documentation](https://github.com/imakshit/Early-Disease-Predicor-Based-on-ML/tree/master/Diabetes_hypertension_depression_prediction_analysis)
